# Working With Pandas DataFrames in Python

We can automate the process of performing data manipulations in Python. It's efficient to spend time
building the code to perform these tasks because once it's built, we can use it
over and over on different datasets that use a similar format. This makes our
methods easily reproducible. We can also easily share our code with colleagues
and they can replicate the same analysis.

### Starting in the same spot

To help the lesson run smoothly, let's ensure everyone is in the same directory.
This should help us avoid path and file name issues. At this time please
navigate to the workshop directory. If you are working in Jupyter Notebook be sure
that you start your notebook in the workshop directory.

A quick aside that there are Python libraries like [OS Library][os-lib] that can work with our
directory structure, however, that is not our focus today.

### Our Data

We are studying ocean waves and temperature in the seas around the UK.

For this lesson we will be using a subset of data from Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). 
WaveNet, Cefas’ strategic wave monitoring network for the United Kingdom, provides a single source of real-time wave data from a network of wave buoys located in areas at risk from flooding. https://wavenet.cefas.co.uk/ 

If we look out to sea, we notice that waves on the sea surface are not simple sinusoids. The surface appears to be composed of random waves of various lengths and periods. How can we describe this complex surface?
 
By making some simplifications and assumptions, we fit an idealised 'spectrum' to describe all the energy held in different wave frequencies. This describes the wave energy at a point, covering the energy in small ripples (high frequency) to long period (low frequency) swell waves. This figure shows an example idealised spectrum, with the highest energy around wave periods of 11 seconds.
 
![An idealised wave spectra for a wave period of 11 seconds](../fig/wave_spectra.png)

We can go a step further, and also associate a wave direction with the amount of energy. These simplifications lead to a 2D wave spectrum at any point in the sea, with dimensions frequency and direction. Directional spreading is a measure of how wave energy for a given sea state is spread as a function of direction of propagation. For example the wave data on the left have a small directional spread, as the waves travel, this can fan out over a wider range of directions.

![A rose diagram of wave energy vs direction](../fig/waves_spreading.png)

When it is very windy or storms pass-over large sea areas, surface waves grow from short choppy wind-sea waves into powerful swell waves. The height and energy of the waves is larger in winter time, when there are more storms. wind-sea waves have short wavelengths / wave periods (like ripples) while swell waves have longer periods (at a lower frequency).

The example file contains a obervations of sea temperatures, and waves properties at different buoys around the UK. 
 
The dataset is stored as a `.csv` file: each row holds information for a
single wave buoy, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
|record_id         | Unique id for the observation      |
|buoy_id           | Unique id for the wave buoy        |
|Name              | Name of the wave buoy                       |
|Date              | Date & time of measurement in day/month/year hour:minute |
|Tz                   | The average wave period (in seconds)            |
|Peak Direction       | The direction of the highest energy waves (in degrees)             |
|Tpeak               | The period of the highest energy waves (in seconds)                |
|Wave Height         | Significant* wave height (in metres)  |
|Temperature       | Water temperature (in degrees C)     |
|Spread               | The "directional spread" at Tpeak (in degrees)    |
|Operations           | Sea safety classification          |
|Seastate             | Categorised by period              |
|Quadrant             | Categorised by prevailing wave direction          |
|------------------|------------------------------------|

 \* "significant" here is defined as the mean wave height (trough to crest) of the highest third of the waves

The first few rows of our first file look like this:

## About Libraries
A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform
tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment
out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project.
Once a library is set up, it can be used or called to perform the task(s)
it was built to do.

## Pandas in Python
One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the
[Python Data Analysis Library][pandas] (a.k.a. Pandas). The
Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with
[matplotlib][matplotlib] and integrates nicely with other libraries
that use [NumPy][numpy] (which is another Python library) arrays.

Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to
add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import
a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the
library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`.  An
example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.

~~~
import pandas as pd
~~~
{: .language-python}

Each time we call a function that's in a library, we use the syntax
`LibraryName.FunctionName`. Adding the library name with a `.` before the
function name tells Python where to find the function. In the example above, we
have imported Pandas as `pd`. This means we don't have to type out `pandas` each
time we call a Pandas function.

# Reading CSV Data Using Pandas

We will begin by locating and reading our wave data which are in CSV format. CSV stands for
Comma-Separated Values and is a common way to store formatted data. Other symbols may also be used, so
you might see tab-separated, colon-separated or space separated files. It is quite easy to replace
one separator with another, to match your application. The first line in the file often has headers
to explain what is in each column. CSV (and other separators) make it easy to share data, and can be
imported and exported from many applications, including Microsoft Excel. For more details on CSV
files, see the [Data Organisation in Spreadsheets][spreadsheet-lesson5] lesson.
We can use Pandas' `read_csv` function to pull the file directly into a [DataFrame][pd-dataframe].

## So What's a DataFrame?

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different
types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more)
in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the `data.frame` in
R. A DataFrame always has an index (0-based). An index refers to the position of
an element in the data structure.

~~~
# Note that pd.read_csv is used because we imported pandas as pd
pd.read_csv("data/waves.csv")
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Referring to libraries
> If you import a library using its full name, you need to use that name when using functions from it.
> If you use a nickname, you can _only_ use the nickname when calling functions from that library
> For example, if you use `import pandas`, you would need to write `pandas.read_csv(...)`, but if you use
> `import pandas as pd`, writing `pandas.read_csv(...)` will show an error of `name 'pandas' is not defined`
{: .callout}

The above command yields the **output** below:

~~~

2073 rows × 13 columns
~~~
{: .output}

We can see that there were 2073 rows parsed. Each row has 13
columns. The first column is the index of the DataFrame. The index is used to
identify the position of the data, but it is not an actual column of the DataFrame
(but note that in this instance we also have a `record_id` which is the same as the index, and
_is_ a column of the DataFrame).
It looks like  the `read_csv` function in Pandas read our file properly. However,
we haven't saved any data to memory so we can work with it. We need to assign the
DataFrame to a variable. Remember that a variable is a name for a value, such as `x`,
or `data`. We can create a new  object with a variable name by assigning a value to it using `=`.

Let's call the imported wave data `waves_df`:

~~~
waves_df = pd.read_csv("data/waves.csv")
~~~
{: .language-python}

Notice when you assign the imported DataFrame to a variable, Python does not
produce any output on the screen. We can view the value of the `waves_df`
object by typing its name into the Python command prompt.

~~~
waves_df
~~~
{: .language-python}

which prints contents like above.

Note: if the output is too wide to print on your narrow terminal window, you may see something
slightly different as the large set of data scrolls past. You may see simply the last column
of data. Never fear, all the data is there, if you scroll up.

If we selecting just a few rows, so it is
easier to fit on one window, you can see that pandas has neatly formatted the data to fit
our screen:

~~~
waves_df.head() # The head() method displays the first several lines of a file. It is discussed below.
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
,record_id,buoy_id,Name,Date,Tz,Peak Direction,Tpeak,Wave Height,Temperature,Spread,Operations,Seastate,Quadrant
0,1,14,SW Isles of Scilly WaveNet Site,17/04/2023 00:00,7.2,263.0,10.0,1.80,10.80,26.0,crew,swell,west
1,2,7,Hayling Island Waverider,17/04/2023 00:00,4.0,193.0,11.1,0.20,10.20,14.0,crew,swell,south
2,3,5,Firth of Forth WaveNet Site,17/04/2023 00:00,3.7,115.0,4.5,0.60,7.80,28.0,crew,windsea,east

4,5,10,M6 Buoy,17/04/2023 00:00,7.6,240.0,11.7,4.50,11.50,89.0,no go,swell,west
~~~
{: .output}

## Exploring Our Wave Buoy Data

Again, we can use the `type` function to see what kind of thing `waves_df` is:

~~~
type(waves_df)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
~~~
{: .output}

As expected, it's a DataFrame (or, to use the full name that Python uses to refer
to it internally, a `pandas.core.frame.DataFrame`).

What kind of things does `waves_df` contain? DataFrames have an attribute
called `dtypes` that answers this:

~~~
waves_df.dtypes
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
record_id           int64
buoy_id             int64
Name               object
Date               object
Tz                float64
Peak Direction    float64
Tpeak             float64
Wave Height       float64
Temperature       float64
Spread            float64
Operations         object
Seastate           object
Quadrant           object
dtype: object
~~~
{: .output}

All the values in a column have the same type. For example, buoy_id have type
`int64`, which is a kind of integer. Cells in the buoy_id column cannot have
fractional values, but the TPeak and Wave Height columns can, because they
have type `float64`. The `object` type doesn't have a very helpful name, but in
this case it represents strings (such as 'swell' and 'windsea' in the case of Seastate).

We'll talk a bit more about what the different formats mean in a different lesson.

### Useful Ways to View DataFrame Objects in Python

There are many ways to summarize and access the data stored in DataFrames,
using **attributes** and **methods** provided by the DataFrame object.

To access an attribute, use the DataFrame object name followed by the attribute
name `df_object.attribute`. Using the DataFrame `waves_df` and attribute
`columns`, an index of all the column names in the DataFrame can be accessed
with `waves_df.columns`.

Methods are called in a similar fashion using the syntax `df_object.method()`.
As an example, `waves_df.head()` gets the first few rows in the DataFrame
`waves_df` using the `head()` method. With a method we can supply extra
information in the parens to control behaviour.

Let's look at the data using these.

## Calculating Statistics From Data In A Pandas DataFrame

We've read our data into Python. Next, let's perform some quick summary
statistics to learn more about the data that we're working with. We might want
to know how many observations were collected in each site, or how many observations
were made at each named buoy. We can perform summary stats quickly using groups. But
first we need to figure out what we want to group by.

Let's begin by exploring our data:

~~~
# Look at the column names
waves_df.columns
~~~
{: .language-python}

which **returns**:

~~~
Index(['record_id', 'buoy_id', 'Name', 'Date', 'Tz', 'Peak Direction', 'Tpeak',
       'Wave Height', 'Temperature', 'Spread', 'Operations', 'Seastate',
       'Quadrant'],
      dtype='object')
~~~
{: .output}

Let's get a list of all the buoys. The `pd.unique` function tells us all of
the unique values in the `Name` column.

~~~
pd.unique(waves_df['Name'])
~~~
{: .language-python}

which **returns**:

~~~
array(['SW Isles of Scilly WaveNet Site', 'Hayling Island Waverider',
       'Firth of Forth WaveNet Site', 'Chesil Waverider', 'M6 Buoy',
       'Lomond', 'Cardigan Bay', 'South Pembrokeshire WaveNet Site',
       'Greenwich Light Vessel', 'west of Hebrides'], dtype=object)
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Challenge - Statistics
>
> 1. Create a list of unique site IDs ("buoy_id") found in the waves data. Call it
>   `buoy_ids`. How many unique sites are there in the data? How many unique
>   buoys are in the data?
>
> 2. What is the difference between using `len(buoy_id)` and `waves_df['buoy_id'].nunique()`?
>    in this case, the result is the same but when might be the difference be important?
{: .challenge}

## Groups in Pandas

We often want to calculate summary statistics grouped by subsets or attributes
within fields of our data. For example, we might want to calculate the average
Wave Height at all buoys per Seastate.

We can calculate basic statistics for all records in a single column using the
syntax below:

~~~
waves_df['Temperature'].describe()
~~~
{: .language-python}

which gives the following

~~~
count    1197.000000
mean       12.872891
std         4.678751
min         5.150000
25%        12.200000
50%        12.950000
75%        17.300000
max        18.700000
Name: Temperature, dtype: float64
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## What counts don't include
> Note that the value of `count` is not the same as the total number of rows. This is because
> statistical methods in Pandas ignore NaN ("not a number") values. We can count the total number of
> of NaNs using `waves_df["Temperature"].isna().sum()`, which returns 876. 876 + 1197 is 2073, which _is_
> the total number of rows in the DataFrame
{: .callout} 

We can also extract one specific metric if we wish:

~~~
waves_df['Temperature'].min()
waves_df['Temperature'].max()
waves_df['Temperature'].mean()
waves_df['Temperature'].std()
waves_df['Temperature'].count()
~~~
{: .language-python}

But if we want to summarize by one or more variables, for example Seastate, we can
use **Pandas' `.groupby` method**. Once we've created a groupby DataFrame, we
can quickly calculate summary statistics by a group of our choice.

~~~
# Group data by Seastate
grouped_data = waves_df.groupby('Seastate')
~~~
{: .language-python}

The Pandas `describe` function will return descriptive stats including: mean,
median, max, min, std and count for a particular column in the data. Pandas'
`describe` function will only return summary values for columns containing
numeric data (does this always make sense?)

~~~
# Summary statistics for all numeric columns by Seastate
grouped_data.describe()
# Provide the mean for each numeric column by Seastate
grouped_data.mean()
~~~
{: .language-python}

`grouped_data.mean()` produces

~~~
record_id,buoy_id,...,Temperature,Spread
,count,mean,std,min,25%,50%,75%,max,count,mean,...,75%,max,count,mean,std,min,25%,50%,75%,max
Seastate,
swell,1747.0,1019.925587,645.553036,1.0,441.50,878.0,1636.5,2073.0,1747.0,11.464797,...,17.4000,18.70,378.0,30.592593,10.035383,14.0,23.0,28.0,36.0,89.0
windsea,326.0,1128.500000,188.099299,3.0,1036.25,1121.5,1273.5,1355.0,326.0,7.079755,...,12.4875,13.35,326.0,25.036810,9.598327,9.0,16.0,25.0,31.0,68.0
2 rows × 64 columns
~~~
{: .output}

The `groupby` command is powerful in that it allows us to quickly generate
summary stats.

This example shows that the wave height associated with water described as 'swell' 
is much larger than the wave heights classified as 'windsea'.

## Quickly Creating Summary Counts in Pandas

Let's next count the number of records for each buoy. We can do this in a few
ways, but we'll use `groupby` combined with **a `count()` method**.


~~~
# Count the number of samples by Name
name_counts = waves_df.groupby('Name')['record_id'].count()
print(name_counts)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Or, we can also count just the rows that have the Name "SW Isle of Scilly WaveNet Site":

~~~
waves_df.groupby('Name')['record_id'].count()['SW Isles of Scilly WaveNet Site']
~~~
{: .language-python}

<!-- > ## Challenge - Make a list

# let's think about this - not sure it adds anything - or could this be where we do an example of nunique?

>
>  What's another way to create a list of countries and associated `count` of the
>  records in the data? Hint: you can perform `count`, `min`, etc. functions on
>  groupby DataFrames in the same way you can perform them on regular DataFrames.
{: .challenge} -->

## Basic Maths Functions

If we wanted to, we could perform math on an entire column of our data. For
example let's convert all the degrees values to radians. 

~~~
# convert the directions from degrees to radians
# Sometimes people use different units for directions, for example we could describe 
# the directions in terms of radians (where a full circle 360 degrees = 2*pi radians)
# To do this we need to use the math library which contains the constant pi

# Convert degrees to radians by multiplying all direction values values by pi/180
import math # the constant pi is stored in the math(s) library, so need to import it
waves_df['Peak Direction'] * math.pi / 180
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Constants
>
> It is normal for code to include variables that have values that should not change, for example. 
> the mathematical value of _pi_. These are called constants. The maths library contains [three
> numerical constants](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#constants): _pi_, _e_, and _tau_, but
> other built-in modules also contain constants. The `os` library (which provides a portable way of using

> `calendar` library contains the days of the week mapped to numerical index (from monday as zero)

> The convention for naming constants is to use block capitals (n.b. `math.pi` doesn't follow this!) and

> ## Challenge - maths & formatting
>
> Convert the temperature colum to Kelvin (adding 273.15 to every value), and round the answer to 1 decimal place
>
>> ## Solution
>> ~~~
>> (waves_df["Temperature"] + 273.15).round(1)
>> ~~~
>> {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Challenge - normalising values
>
> Sometimes, we need to _normalise_ values. A common way of doing this is to scale values between 0 and 1, using 
> `y = (x - min) / (max - min)`. Using this equation, scale the Temperature column
>
>> ## Solution
>> ~~~
>> x = waves_df["Temperature"]
>> y = (x - x.min()) / (x.max() - x.min())
>> ~~~
>> {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

A more practical use of this might
be to normalize the data according to a mean, area, or some other value
calculated from our data.
